When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i want to share my work with other people
  When i work from different computers
  
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
    There may be changes to the remote repository of which i am unaware and would not want to copy to my local version
