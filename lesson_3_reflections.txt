When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i want to share my work with other people
  When i work from different computers
  
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
    There may be changes to the remote repository of which i am unaware and would not want to copy to my local version


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    
    A fork is a copy of a repository from Github to another Github repository
    A clone is a copy of a Github repository onto the local machine or from the local machine to the local machine
    A branch is simply braching away from the master branch in order to work on something that may be different to the master branch, it could be a new or experimental feature and is rarely production quality. The master branch on the other hand is typically production quality.
